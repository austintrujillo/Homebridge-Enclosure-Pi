# Homebridge Enclosure for RPi Zero W

</span>

#### What is Homebridge?

[Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. It supports Plugins, which are community-contributed modules that provide a basic bridge from HomeKit to various 3rd-party APIs provided by manufacturers of "smart home" devices.

You can explore all available plugins at the NPM website by [searching for the keyword `homebridge-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=homebridge-plugin).

## Parts List

* [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)
* 4x [M3x8 Socket Head Screws (Fully Threaded)](https://www.mcmaster.com/screws/thread-size~m3/system-of-measurement~metric/alloy-steel-socket-head-screws-8/length~8-mm/)
* [Micro USB Cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DSPBKD7/)

## 3D Printing

This was printed on an [Ender 5 Pro](https://www.creality.com/goods-detail/ender-5-pro-3d-printer) FDM printer using [white Hatchbox ABS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J0H6NNM/). I printed with 100% infill with supports only on the underside of the lid. The print was finished using light sanding and acetone anealing. I am still working on finding an economical solution for coloring the lid while maintaining a clean and polished look.
