# Homebridge Enclosure for RPi Zero W

</span>

#### What is Homebridge?

[Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. It supports Plugins, which are community-contributed modules that provide a basic bridge from HomeKit to various 3rd-party APIs provided by manufacturers of "smart home" devices.

You can explore all available plugins at the NPM website by [searching for the keyword `homebridge-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=homebridge-plugin).
